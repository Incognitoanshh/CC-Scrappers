# What is this?
This is an npm module where it scrapes popular credit card webpages and try my best to neatly put the useful information into a clean data structure for people to use in their projects. Hopefully, it'll be useful to build out fin-tech applications üôè

The vision is to build this out in multiple languages (next is Python, thirdly will be Rust).
But, after I am done with this javascript package, I will try to migrate this over to an actual live, hosted API.

Please look through the issues and projects tabs for the future plans of `cc-scraper`.
